# Multi-System Application

This Go project is the **first assignment** for the **Advanced Programming 1** course at **Astana IT University**. It has been developed by **Tulebayev Miras**. The project contains multiple reusable packages (`pkg`) for different systems, including a **Library Management System**, a **Bank Account System**, a **Shapes Management System**, and an **Employee Management System**. Each package is modular and implements its functionality with clear interfaces and methods, adhering to Go's best practices.

## **Packages Overview**

### 1. **Library Management System** (`pkg/library`)

The `library` package provides functionality to manage a library's book collection. It allows adding, borrowing, returning, and listing books.

#### **Key Features**
- **Add Books**: Add new books to the library.
- **Borrow Books**: Mark books as borrowed.
- **Return Books**: Mark borrowed books as returned.
- **List Books**: Display all books with their availability status.

#### **Usage Example**
```go
lib := library.NewLibrary()
lib.AddBook(library.Book{ID: "101", Title: "Go Programming", Author: "John Doe"})
lib.BorrowBook("101")
lib.ListBooks()
```

---

### 2. **Bank Account System** (`pkg/bank`)

The `bank` package simulates a bank account system. It supports depositing, withdrawing, checking balance, and batch processing transactions.

#### **Key Features**
- **Deposit Money**: Add money to the account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Deduct money from the account if sufficient funds are available.
- **Check Balance**: Display the current account balance.
- **Batch Transactions**: Process multiple deposits and withdrawals.

#### **Usage Example**
```go
account := bank.BankAccount{AccountNumber: "12345", HolderName: "John Doe", Balance: 0}
account.Deposit(1000)
account.Withdraw(200)
bank.Transaction(&account, []float64{500, -100, 300})
account.GetBalance()
```

---

### 3. **Shapes Management System** (`pkg/shapes`)

The `shapes` package provides functionality to calculate the area and perimeter of various geometric shapes, such as rectangles, circles, squares, and triangles.

#### **Key Features**
- **Shape Interface**: Generic interface for calculating area and perimeter.
- **Shapes**:
  - Rectangle: `shapes.Rectangle`
  - Circle: `shapes.Circle`
  - Square: `shapes.Square`
  - Triangle: `shapes.Triangle`
- **Utility Function**: `PrintShapeDetails` displays the area and perimeter of any shape.

#### **Usage Example**
```go
shapesList := []shapes.Shape{
    shapes.Rectangle{Length: 10, Width: 5},
    shapes.Circle{Radius: 7},
    shapes.Square{Length: 4},
    shapes.Triangle{SideA: 3, SideB: 4, SideC: 5},
}
for _, shape := range shapesList {
    shapes.PrintShapeDetails(shape)
}
```

### 4. **Employee Management System** (`pkg/employee`)

The `employee` package provides functionality to manage employees in a company, supporting both full-time and part-time employees.

#### **Key Features**
- **Employee Interface**: Shared interface for all employee types.
- **Full-Time Employees**: `employee.FullTimeEmployee` stores salary-based employees.
- **Part-Time Employees**: `employee.PartTimeEmployee` stores hourly-based employees.
- **Company**: `employee.Company` manages employees and provides methods to add and list employees.

#### **Usage Example**
```go
c := employee.NewCompany()
c.AddEmployee(employee.FullTimeEmployee{ID: 1, Name: "Alice", Salary: 5000})
c.AddEmployee(employee.PartTimeEmployee{ID: 2, Name: "Bob", HourlyRate: 20, HoursWorked: 100})
c.ListEmployees()
```
